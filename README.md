# Project 3: Encrypted Email Server
Your job is to build a program that lets a users "register" with a username and password. Login to their account with their password. See a list of other users. Send a message to another user. Read their received messages. Each message needs to be stored encrypted. That does imply that it is the responsibility of your users to communicate a secret passphrase shared by the two users.

There is a lot of room for security thinking in this, so show me what you got.
